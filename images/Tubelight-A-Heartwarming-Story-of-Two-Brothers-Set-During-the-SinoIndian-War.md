The Hollywood Reporter called Tubelight "a departure from your regular Salman Khan mass entertainer" and said that the actor "cannot move mountains with his performance but he manages to keep the faith alive". The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and said that it "breaks the parameters of conventional Bollywood male bravado and presents a vulnerable but gallant protagonist who lets his heart lead him through the complexities of the world around him". Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 27% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 5.02 out of 10. IMDb gave the film a rating of 3.9 out of 10 based on 21,000 user ratings.
 
Tubelight is a film that tries to convey a message of peace, love and brotherhood, but fails to do so convincingly. The film is a missed opportunity for Salman Khan and Kabir Khan, who have delivered better films in the past. Tubelight is not a bad film, but it is not a good one either. It is a film that flickers slowly to life, but never shines brightly.
  
Tubelight also features some catchy songs composed by Pritam and written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The songs are sung by various artists like Kamaal Khan, Nakash Aziz, Dev Negi, Tushar Joshi and Jubin Nautiyal. The songs reflect the mood and theme of the film, ranging from upbeat and cheerful to emotional and melancholic. Some of the popular songs from the film are Naach Meri Jaan, Radio, Tinka Tinka Dil Mera and Main Agar.
 
Naach Meri Jaan is a celebration of brotherhood and love, featuring Salman Khan and Sohail Khan dancing and singing with joy. The song has been praised for its catchy tune and energetic choreography. Radio is a retro-style song that shows Salman Khan announcing the news of his brother's return on a radio show. The song has a nostalgic feel and a catchy chorus. Tinka Tinka Dil Mera is a heart-wrenching song that expresses Salman Khan's pain and longing for his brother. The song has been appreciated for its soulful melody and lyrics. Main Agar is a romantic song that shows Salman Khan's bond with Zhu Zhu and Matin Rey Tangu. The song has a soothing and melodious feel.
